The following diagram illustrates the high-level architecture of the system:

![Architecture Diagram](./images/Diagram.png)


1. Developer pushes code changes to GitHub.
2. GitHub Actions runs automated workflows:
   - Build and test the app.
   - Containerize the app with Docker.
   - Push the image to the registry.
   - Package Helm charts for deployment.
3. ArgoCD continuously monitors the GitOps repo and syncs manifests to the EKS cluster.
4. The Solar System app is deployed inside Kubernetes pods.
5. Prometheus scrapes metrics from the cluster and Grafana visualizes them.

## ⚙️ CI/CD Workflow with GitHub Actions

This repository uses GitHub Actions for CI/CD and security scanning. Workflow files are primarily located under `.github/workflows/`. In addition, a `docker.yaml` workflow is present in the repo root and is used for image build/push steps. See the repository tree for the exact, current workflow filenames and contents. :contentReference[oaicite:17]{index=17}


---

### 🏗️ Workflows Overview

- **`main_pipeline.yaml`** → Orchestrates all jobs (build, test, scan, deploy).
- **`docker.yaml`** → Builds and pushes Docker images to both Docker Hub and GitHub Container Registry (GHCR).
- **`coverage.yaml`** → Runs test coverage analysis on the application.
- **`trivy.yml`** → Scans for vulnerabilities in dependencies and Docker images.
- **`argocd-deploy.yaml`** → Triggers ArgoCD sync to deploy Helm charts to Kubernetes.
- **`terraform.yaml`** → Provisions AWS infrastructure (e.g., EKS cluster, VPCs, IAM roles) using Terraform.
- **`observability.yaml`** → for monitoring deploy in EKS.

---

### 🧩 Workflow Stages (as executed in `main_pipeline.yaml`)

1. **Checkout Code**
   - Uses `actions/checkout` to pull the latest source code.

2. **Build & Test**
   - Runs application unit tests and coverage (`coverage.yaml`).

3. **Docker Build & Push**
   - Builds Docker image from `app/Dockerfile`.
   - Runs a live container smoke test (`/live` endpoint).
   - Pushes image to:
     - **Docker Hub** (credentials from secrets `DOCKER_USERNAME`, `DOCKER_PASSWORD`)
     - **GitHub Container Registry (GHCR)** (credentials from `GHCR_USERNAME`, `GHCR_TOKEN`)

4. **Security Scanning with Trivy**
   - Scans both source code and Docker images for vulnerabilities.
   - Fails the pipeline if critical CVEs are found.

5. **Helm Chart Packaging**
   - Packages Kubernetes manifests from the `helm/` directory.

6. **ArgoCD Sync**
   - Deploys updated Helm chart to Amazon EKS via `argocd-deploy.yaml`.

7. **Terraform Infrastructure**
   - Optionally provisions AWS resources (`Terraform/team-01`) before application deployment.

---

### 🔒 Secrets Used

- `DOCKER_USERNAME`, `DOCKER_PASSWORD` → Docker Hub credentials  
- `GHCR_USERNAME`, `GHCR_TOKEN` → GitHub Container Registry credentials  
- `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`, `AWS_REGION` → AWS credentials for Terraform & EKS  
- `ARGOCD_SERVER`, `ARGOCD_AUTH_TOKEN` → ArgoCD API access for GitOps sync  
  

## 🔐 Security Scanning (Trivy)

This repository runs container and dependency vulnerability scanning with **Trivy** as part of CI/CD.

- **Where it lives:** `.github/workflows/trivy.yml`
- **How it runs:** Called from the main pipeline as a reusable workflow (see `.github/workflows/main_pipeline.yaml`, job `security`).
- **What it scans:**
  - The **repository filesystem** (dependencies / IaC) for known CVEs.
  - The **Docker image** built for this commit before publishing.
- **Outcome:** Scan results are attached as workflow artifacts; if critical issues are detected (as configured in `trivy.yml`), the pipeline fails and downstream jobs are blocked.

### View results in GitHub Actions
1. Go to **Actions → Main Pipeline** for the commit.
2. Open the **security** job.
3. Download the attached Trivy report artifacts if present.

## ☸️ Kubernetes & Helm Deployment

The **deployment stage** of the pipeline is handled using **Helm**, which simplifies Kubernetes resource management.  
Instead of manually applying multiple YAML manifests, Helm packages them into a reusable **chart**.

---

### 📦 Helm Chart Structure
```
helm/
├── Chart.yaml # Metadata about the chart (name, version, description)
├── values.yaml # Default values (e.g., image tag, replica count, service type)
└── templates/ # Kubernetes manifest templates (deployment, service, ingress, etc.)
├── deployment.yaml
├── service.yaml
└── ingress.yaml
```

---

### 🧩 Deployment Workflow
1. **Build & Push Docker Image**  
   The application is containerized and stored in a registry (Docker Hub or ECR).  

2. **Update Helm Values**  
   The pipeline updates the `values.yaml` file with the new Docker image tag.  

3. **Install/Upgrade Release**  
   Helm is used to either install the app (first time) or upgrade it (subsequent runs).  

---

🌐 Accessing the Application

The Helm chart defines a Service (ClusterIP / NodePort / LoadBalancer).

If using a LoadBalancer service (AWS EKS default), an external endpoint will be provisioned.

---

🔑 Benefits of Using Helm

Reusability → Charts can be reused across environments (dev, staging, prod).

Scalability → Easily adjust replicas, resources, and configs.

Versioning → Each release is tracked, enabling rollbacks if needed.

Simplicity → One command (helm upgrade) updates the entire deployment.

---

## 🔄 GitOps with ArgoCD

This project follows **GitOps principles** for managing Kubernetes deployments.  
Instead of applying changes directly to the cluster, all configurations are stored in **Git**, and **ArgoCD** ensures the cluster state matches the repository state.
![ArgoCD](https://github.com/AbdullahWahdan/GitAction_SolarSystem/blob/main/readmeimage/argocdwork.jpg)

---

### 🧭 What is GitOps?
- **Declarative**: Infrastructure and application definitions are written as code (YAML/Helm).  
- **Version-Controlled**: All manifests are stored in Git, providing full history and audit trails.  
- **Automated**: A GitOps operator (ArgoCD) continuously syncs the cluster with the Git repository.  
- **Reliable**: Any drift (difference between repo and cluster) is detected and can be auto-corrected.

---

### 🛠️ ArgoCD in This Project
1. Watches the **GitHub repository** for changes to manifests/Helm charts.  
2. Syncs changes automatically to the **Amazon EKS cluster**.  
3. Provides a **web UI and CLI** for monitoring, rollbacks, and manual syncs.  

---

🚀 GitOps Workflow

Developer commits code → triggers GitHub Actions.

CI builds & pushes Docker image → updates Helm values in Git.

ArgoCD detects changes in Git → applies updated Helm chart to EKS.

Application is redeployed automatically → cluster state always matches Git.

---

🎨 ArgoCD UI

ArgoCD provides a visual dashboard where you can:

View application health and sync status.

Compare live vs desired state.

Roll back to previous versions.

Trigger manual syncs if needed.

---

🔑 Benefits of GitOps in This Project

Full Traceability → Every deployment is linked to a Git commit.

Consistency → Same manifests are applied across environments.

Self-Healing → If cluster drifts from desired state, ArgoCD restores it.

Separation of Concerns → CI builds artifacts; CD (via ArgoCD) applies manifests.

---

## 📊 Monitoring & Observability

A critical part of DevOps pipelines is ensuring that applications are **observable** once deployed.  
This project integrates **Prometheus** and **Grafana** to provide monitoring and visualization of the Solar System app and Kubernetes cluster.

---

### 📡 Prometheus (Metrics Collection)
- Scrapes metrics from Kubernetes pods, services, and nodes.  
- Collects key time-series data such as CPU usage, memory consumption, request latency, and error rates.  
- Uses exporters like **kube-state-metrics** and **node-exporter** for cluster-level health.  

---

### 📈 Grafana (Visualization & Dashboards)
- Connects to Prometheus as a data source.  
- Provides interactive dashboards for:
  - Application response times  
  - Pod CPU/memory usage  
  - EKS cluster health  
  - Request success vs failure rates  
- Can be configured with **alerts** to detect anomalies (e.g., high error rate, resource saturation).
- ![argoCD](https://github.com/AbdullahWahdan/GitAction_SolarSystem/blob/main/readmeimage/grafana.jpg)

---

### 🧩 Workflow
1. The application is deployed into EKS via Helm/ArgoCD.  
2. Prometheus scrapes metrics from workloads and cluster components.  
3. Grafana queries Prometheus and visualizes data on dashboards.  

---

### 🔑 Benefits
- **Real-time monitoring** of workloads and cluster health.  
- **Historical analysis** of performance and reliability trends.  
- **Proactive alerting** to detect issues early.  
- **Single-pane visibility** across app and infrastructure metrics.
